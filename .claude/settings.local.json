Fix repeated user input requests:\n- Add `askedForInitialInput` flag to track initial message sent\n- Ensure agent only asks for initial input once, not repeatedly\n- Move iteration increment after initial input check\n- Agent now truly blocks and waits after asking question once\n\n2. Implement workflow dependency-based execution:\n- Only start agents with no incoming edges (no dependencies)\n- Add A2A monitor in server to listen for AGENT_COMPLETE messages\n- Automatically start next agents when all their dependencies are satisfied\n- Track completed agents in executionState\n- Check dependencies before starting each agent\n- Example: planner → artist → developer will execute sequentially\n\nThis ensures:\n- Agent asks question once and waits patiently\n- Workflow executes in correct dependency order\n- Next agent only starts when previous agent completes\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
